# Welcome to BryanBot
BryanBot is open-source Discord bot that aims to provide fully modular and customizable experience for server owners and developers.<br />
Built with JavaScript and Discord.js library, BryanBot is designed to be easy to both use and develop for.

## Features
The bot itself is built around **addons**, which are meant to add commands and other functionality to the bot. That's why the core does not come with a lot of commands by default. The bot is meant to be customized to your liking.

Default commands that come with BryanBot are `help` and `info`. They are used to provide information about the bot and its commands.

The bot also comes with backup system that automatically backs up your configuration.

## Developer features
While not providing a lot of default functionality, BryanBot is built to be easily extended. That's why it comes with a lot of developer features, such as:
- **Command handler** - easily add new commands to the bot
- **Event handler** - handle Discord.js events with ease
- **Addon system** - extend the bot with addons and keep everything modular
- **Config system** - store and access configuration values and keep them organized
- **Database handler** - easily connect and store data in a database
- **Utility functions** - a lot of utility functions to make your life easier
And a lot more!
