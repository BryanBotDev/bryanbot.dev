# Community Developer Guidelines
- "We", "Us", "Our" refer to the BryanBot Development Team.
- "You", "Your" refer to the **Community Developers.**
- "Third Party Developers" refer to any developers who are not in contact with us and have not read this document.

> You, for the entirety of the time that you are holding the title and included within the position of **Community Developer**, are bound by this agreement and any direct or indirect violations will have consequences. In case of resigning from the position, you will no longer be bound by this agreement until you will once again be holding the title and included within the position of **Community Developer**.

## Community Developers
1. All resources must be submitted for verification before being published. No exceptions will be made.
2. Do not publicly call out any users or developers in the event of a dispute or conflict between two parties. Contact BryanBot staff instead.
3. You are not allowed to publish addons explicitly made by another third-party developer under any conditions.

## Resources Submitted
1. Submitted resources may not contain any piece of code with the intention of benefiting the developer from the user's hardware or software.
2. All submitted resources must consist primarily of your code. If you are found to be plagiarizing code from elsewhere, we reserve the right to remove you from the position of a **Community Developer**. You are allowed to use third-party or licensed code if permission is granted, but you are required to disclose that you have used code from a third party and the original author of the used code.
	- You are not allowed to publish addons explicitly created by a third-party developer, regardless of your connection to them.
	- You are responsible for the safety and security of any third-party code you have included in your addons.
3. You are responsible for keeping your codebase clean and free of bugs for the duration of your holding the title of **Community Developer**. Any unmaintained addons must be strictly disclosed to be unmaintained and therefore possibly prone to bugs and/or vulnerabilities.

## Publishing resources
1. Add verified resource should be published on the <u>verified marketplace</u>.
	- You are able to request verification of any platform you want to publish your resources on.
2. All threads for verified resources should include official branding for verified work.
	- You are not allowed to use verified branding on resources that were not verified by BryanBot staff even if you are **Community Developer**.
3. All published resources need to clearly state that they are made for BryanBot along with link to the official GitHub repository of the project.

## Our Rights
1. We reserve the right to remove you from the position of a **Community Developer** anytime, for any reason.
	- Needless to say, we will always provide proper reasoning, but you must keep in mind that we do hold the right to do so.
2. We hold the right to investigate your code without prior notice, for any reason, and you are obliged to respond positively. Exceptions will be handled on a case-by-case basis.

## Your Rights
1. You, naturally, reserve the right to resign from your position as **Community Developer**, forfeiting all benefits coming from said position.
2. While BryanBot Development Team is fitting the definition of organizations engaged in **professional or commercial activity** as stated by the GDPR, <u>we do not</u> collect any data from our users for commercial purposes and therefore are not bound by GDPR; however, you, as a **Community Developer**, are unofficially eligible for requesting your data.
3. You may inquire about the usage of collected information and how it is processed, anytime for any reason.
4. You get to object to any of the lines within this document with proper reasoning provided, as well as to request changes; however, you must keep in mind that:
	- We may veto your objections.
	- Refuse to make any changes,
5. All sales you make will be collected entirely by you; we will not intervene with the funds received by you.
