# BryanBot Community
BryanBot is a community-driven project. We are always looking for ways to improve the bot and to make it more accessible for the community. This page is dedicated to the community and the developers who are contributing to the project.

## Community Support
We have a [dedicated server for the BryanBot community](https://discord.gg/GvyuDDFeZU). If you have any questions, suggestions, or need help with the bot, feel free to join the server and ask for help. Our support team is always ready to help you with any issues you might have.

## Community Developers
We are focused on development made by the community. While we do not limit the independent development for the bot, we do run **Verified Community Developers** program. This program is designed to help developers to get their work recognized and to help them to get more users for their projects.

### Joining the Program
In order to join the program, you need to submit at least one resource for verification. More about the verification process can be found in the section below.

### Addon Verification
Verification is a process where we check the submitted resources for any malicious code, bugs, or other issues. We also check if the resource is following the guidelines set by the BryanBot Development Team. If the resource passes the verification process, it will be marked as verified and the developer will get the verified badge.

#### Verification Process
1. **Submit the resource** - You need to submit the resource for verification. You can do this through the [support server](https://discord.gg/GvyuDDFeZU).
2. **Verification** - We will check the resource for any issues. If the resource passes the verification process, it will be marked as verified.
3. **Publishing** - After the resource is verified, you can publish it on the verified marketplace.

### Publishing Resources
After resource verification, you can publish the resource on one of the verified marketplaces. More information about that can be found [here](/docs/community/marketplaces).
