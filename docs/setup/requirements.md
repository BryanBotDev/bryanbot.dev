# Requirements
BryanBot is very easy to set up and use, but there are some requirements you need to meet before you can start using it.

## Hosting
For hosting the bot, you will need a machine that can run Node.js. This can be your personal computer, a VPS, or a managed hosting service. For keeping the bot online 24/7, it is recommended to use a VPS or a managed hosting service.

The option that you choose needs to have Node.js installed on it. If you are going to use a VPS or personal computer, you can download Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/). Managed hosting services usually come with Node.js pre-installed.

### Recommended hosting services
We recommend using one of the following hosting services:
- [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) - affordable VPS hosting
- [NovoNode](https://novonode.com/) - affordable managed hosting
- [Sparked Host](https://sparkedhost.com/) - user-friendly managed hosting
